Apply SQL to answer business-driven questions. 

## SQL Scripts

- **create_view**

Get to know VIEWs better by creating one that easily shows the columns for every table in the dataset. This allows for a good overall sense of the db. 

- **entity_r_d**

Question: Which films are most frequently rented? 

There are two tables that include the info we need for this question: 
the film table, and the rental table.

They do not have corresponding columns to inner join on, so we need an additonal table (inventory) to tie them together. This process is called Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and is needed to connect tables in this way. 

- **create_tab**

Create a new table from scratch: oscars. 
As well as a new table based on other existing tables information: family_films.

- **cut_products**

Cut out products from inventory that are not doing well, such as too high replacement cost.
